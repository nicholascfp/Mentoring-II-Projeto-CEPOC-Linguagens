# Mentoring II - Projeto CEPOC Linguagens
The project was developed during second semester of 2020 in partnership with [PUCMINAS University](https://www.pucpcaldas.br/) and 
[CEPOC School](http://cepoc.com.br/), in order to create some tools that can help teachers in their teaching methodology, during Covid-19 pandemic. 

Our team`s project was responsible to support portuguese teacher teaching grammatics and abbreviations to students of about 12 to 13 years old.

The application was built using [MIT Appinventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).
